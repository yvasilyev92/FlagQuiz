This app shows how to use Fragments, Menus, Preferences, Explicit Intents, Handler, AssetManager, Tweened Animations,
Animators, Toasts, Color State Lists, Layouts for Multiple Device Orientations, and Logging Error Messages for Debugging.

This app shows how to use Fragments to make better use of available screen real estate in an Activity's GUI on phones and tablets,
display a settings icon on the app bar to enable users to access the app's user preferences, use a PreferenceFragment to automatically
manage and persist an app's user preferences, use a SharedPreferences.Editor to modify key-value pairs of data associated with an app,
use an app's assets subfolders to organize image resources and manipulate them with an AssetManager, define an animation and apply it to a
View, and use a Handler to schedule a future task to perform on the GUI thread.

I, myself, specifically commented on every line of code so that a beginner Android developer may clearly understand and learn from this application.
